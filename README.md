# Overview
**This is currently mostly not my own work**
Go to [UDP Peer-To-Peer Messaging With Python - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbzGL_tjmv4) for a better video.
Though I will say that it took a while for me to change it so it would work for me...

I was able to get a connection from a client to server, but I will still be updating this. But as of now this is what I accomplished. 

Currently this is a Client to Server type of setup. To connect you will need to run the server first then the client. In this case I was running two different clients, but if you have two separate computers, just get the ip address of which ever will be the host computer and change the ip address that is currently set in the client program.

The purpose for writing this server was for me to learn how to communicate from one computer to another.

Here is my video:

# Network Communication

The setup I have here is for peer to peer, unless you only have one device...

I am using UDP

The messages being sent are messages or strings that have been turned into bytes.

# Development Environment

VS Code

Python - libraries include: socket and threading
